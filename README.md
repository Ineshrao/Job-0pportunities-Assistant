# Job Opportunities Assistant

## Project Description
The Job Opportunities Assistant is an online training and placement system aimed at automating and streamlining the placement activities in colleges. The existing manual system for managing student data, notifying students about placement drives, and shortlisting students based on company requirements is time-consuming and prone to errors. This project addresses these challenges by providing a computerized module that enhances the efficiency and accuracy of placement procedures.
